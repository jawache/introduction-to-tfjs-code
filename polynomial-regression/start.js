/**
 * The equation for a polynomial (curved line) is this
 *
 * Y = A*X^2 + B*X + C
 *
 * Very similar to the linear regression example previously except now there are 3 variables to optimise, A, B and C instead of just A + C
 *
 *
 * See if you can change this file so it fits a polynomial curve instead.
